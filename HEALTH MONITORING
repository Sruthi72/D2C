People with certain medical disorders, including diabetes, high blood pressure, or food allergies, have trouble finding foods in supermarkets and grocery stores that suit their particular dietary requirements. Present-day food labels and nutritional data can be confusing and challenging to understand in real time, resulting in consumers making ignorant purchases that could be harmful to their health. There is currently no seamless system that connects real-time health data with product recommendations made on the spot, despite developments in wearable health monitoring. An intelligent solution is required, one that analyzes supermarket goods in real time based on the customers' current health metrics and dietary limitations, enabling them to make *informed, health-conscious choices. **AI-driven product analysis* and *real-time IoT health data* cannot be integrated by current technology.
